Project Vision: Connecting Business Reality with Data

Cafes have always interested me;not just as social spaces, but as fast-moving businesses where small operational gaps can quietly impact revenue.
During peak hours, orders move quickly, staff multitask, and documentation can easily fall behind. 
This led me to a fundamental question:
Is the business operating at its full potential, or is the 'busy-ness' of daily operations masking opportunities for growth and refinement?

This project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle and adapted to simulate a realistic cafe business environment.
I approached it not as a data exercise, but as a business diagnosis—treating the dataset like real operational data from a functioning company.

Instead of “fixing” the dataset to make it perfect, I deliberately preserved common real-world issues such as missing totals, incomplete fields, and inconsistent entries. These issues often represent the exact points where businesses lose visibility, control, and revenue.
The goal of this project was to demonstrate how structured analysis can transform messy data into clear insights and actionable strategy.
