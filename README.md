Project Vision: Connecting Business Reality with Data

Cafes have always interested me;not just as social spaces, but as fast-moving businesses where small operational gaps can quietly impact revenue.
During peak hours, orders move quickly, staff multitask, and documentation can easily fall behind.

This led me to a fundamental question:

Is the business operating at its full potential, or is the 'busy-ness' of daily operations masking opportunities for growth and refinement?

This project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle and adapted to simulate a realistic cafe business environment.
I approached it not as a data exercise, but as a business diagnosis treating the dataset like real operational data from a functioning company.

Instead of “fixing” the dataset to make it perfect, I deliberately preserved common real-world issues such as missing totals, incomplete fields, and inconsistent entries. These issues often represent the exact points where businesses lose visibility, control, and revenue.
The goal of this project was to demonstrate how structured analysis can transform messy data into clear insights and actionable strategy.

Strategic Focus Areas

My analysis and recommendations focus on four key areas that reflect both business performance and operational health:

Category 1: Revenue Capture & Financial Accuracy

Reviewed transactions with missing or inconsistent values to identify potential revenue leakage, with specific focus on the 463 transactions where sales were not fully recorded.

Category 2: Operational Visibility & Channel Performance

Analyzed the 40% gap in location data to better understand the true distribution of demand between In-store and Takeaway orders.

Category 3: Product Portfolio Performance

Evaluated product performance to identify the core items (such as salads, smoothies, and sandwiches) that contribute the largest share of revenue, supporting more informed menu and positioning decisions.

Category 4: Time-Based Growth & Seasonality

Analyzed sales trends across months and days to identify peak periods and understand how higher transaction volumes affect both performance and data quality.
